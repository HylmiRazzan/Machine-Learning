Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses labeled data to predict outcomes. It models the relationship between independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output) by fitting a line (or plane, if there are multiple independent variables) to the data.

In the case of one independent variable and one dependent variable, it’s called Simple Linear Regression. When there are multiple independent variables predicting a single target variable, it’s known as Multiple Linear Regression.

In both cases, the goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.
